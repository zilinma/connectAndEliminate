## Introduction
This project is a game of matching and cancelling tiles from a board of tiles. 
User is allowed to choose the difficulties and the themes for the images of the 
tiles. Shuffle and hint buttons are provided if the user is stuck during the 
game. We also provide a exciting background music. A time bar is shown at the 
bottom of the program let the user know how much remaining time they have. The 
game will end as the time bar finished. 

As some extra features to the game, music will be played at the start of the 
game. During the game, user can choose to pause the game and then save or load 
saved game. As all tiles are cancelled within the time limit, the game will 
level up. There's also a scoring system a score board within the game. Please 
use Resume button when paused and do not close the window directly!

If interested in the implementation of the game, please refer to the design 
manual:
